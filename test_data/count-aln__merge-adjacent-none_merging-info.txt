 MERGING opposite-strand same-position tandem mutants: chromosome_A - ?-501 and chromosome_A + 500-?, 1 and 1 reads.

 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
  same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 99-? and chromosome_A + 100-?, 1 and 5 reads.
  same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 100-? and chromosome_A + 101-?, 5 and 1 reads.
  same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 300-? and chromosome_A + 301-?, 1 and 1 reads.
  adjacent opposite-strand away-facing mutants: chromosome_A + 600-? and chromosome_A - ?-602.
# Finished counting (actually counted mutants up to distance 10000, but only printing info for up to distance 1 - you can get the full data from the pickle file). Adjacent mutant counts (max distance 1): 3 adjacent same-strand pairs, 0 same-position opposite-strand pairs, 1 adjacent opposite-strand away-facing pairs (may be tandems with a deletion), 0 adjacent opposite-strand toward-facing pairs (definitely two separate mutants).
