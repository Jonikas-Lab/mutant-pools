# Merging adjacent mutants: max distance 2, min count ratio 3
 (The merged mutant will have the position of whichever original mutant had more reads)
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
 MERGING same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 99-? and chromosome_A + 100-?, 1 and 5 reads.
Warning: attempting to merge a mutant that no longer exists chromosome_A + 99-? with chromosome_A + 101-?!
 MERGING same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 100-? and chromosome_A + 101-?, 6 and 1 reads.
 MERGING same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 200-? and chromosome_A + 202-?, 3 and 1 reads.
# Finished merging adjacent mutants: 3 pairs merged
# Merging opposite-strand same-position mutants (presumably tail-to-tail tandems)
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
 MERGING opposite-strand same-position tandem mutants: chromosome_A + 500-? and chromosome_A - ?-501.
# Finished merging opposite-strand same-position mutants: 1 pairs merged
# Counting adjacent mutants: actually counting mutants up to distance 10000, but only printing info for up to distance 2 - you can get the full data from the pickle file
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
  same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 300-? and chromosome_A + 301-?, 1 and 1 reads.
  adjacent opposite-strand away-facing mutants: chromosome_A + 600-? and chromosome_A - ?-602.
  adjacent opposite-strand away-facing mutants: chromosome_A + 700-? and chromosome_A - ?-703.
# Finished counting (actually counted mutants up to distance 10000, but only printing info for up to distance 2 - you can get the full data from the pickle file). Adjacent mutant counts (max distance 2): 1 adjacent same-strand pairs, 0 same-position opposite-strand pairs, 2 adjacent opposite-strand away-facing pairs (may be tandems with a deletion), 0 adjacent opposite-strand toward-facing pairs (definitely two separate mutants).
