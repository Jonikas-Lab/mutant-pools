 * Reads discarded in preprocessing (% of total):	None (unknown)
    discarded due to wrong start (% of total):	None (unknown)
    discarded due to no cassette (% of total):	None (unknown)
 * Reads without a unique alignment (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	0 (0%, 0%)
    unaligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	0 (0%, 0%)
    multiply aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	0 (0%, 0%)
 * Uniquely aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	3 (100%, 100%)

    Reads aligned to cassette_3_confirming (% of aligned):	3 (100%)
 * Distinct mutants (read groups) by cassette insertion position:	2
    (mutants with 2+, 10+, 100+, 1000+ reads):	(1, 0, 0, 0)
    (read location with respect to cassette: which end, which direction):	(3prime, outward)
