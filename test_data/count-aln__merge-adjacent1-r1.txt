### SUMMARY:
## Total reads in sample:	25+unknown
## Reads discarded in preprocessing (% of total):	unknown (unknown)
#  discarded due to wrong start (% of total):	unknown (unknown)
#  discarded due to no cassette (% of total):	unknown (unknown)
## Reads without a unique alignment (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	0 (0%, 0%)
#  unaligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	0 (0%, 0%)
#  multiply aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	0 (0%, 0%)
## Uniquely aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	25 (100%, 100%)
#  Perfectly aligned reads, no mismatches (% of aligned):	22 (88%)
#  Reads with cassette direction matching chromosome + strand (% of aligned):	22 (88%)
#  Reads with cassette direction matching chromosome - strand (% of aligned):	3 (12%)
## Mutant merging/counts (deciding when different-position reads should be one mutant)	
#   (adjacent-merging/counting max distance):	(1)
#   (if we're including mutants in cassette and in non-nuclear chromosomes):	(False, False)
#  merged same-strand adjacent mutant pairs and opposite-strand tandem pairs:	3, 1
#  remaining same-position opposite-strand pairs (if not merged as tandems):	0
#  remaining adjacent opposite-strand "toward-facing" pairs (those are definitely real):	0
#  remaining adjacent opposite-strand "away-facing" pairs (% of toward-facing):	1 (N/A)
#  remaining adjacent same-strand unmerged pairs (% of 2*toward-facing):	0 (N/A)
## Distinct mutants (read groups) by cassette insertion position:	11
#  (read location with respect to cassette: which end, which direction):	(5prime, forward)
#  (average and median reads per mutant):	(2, 1)
#  Most common mutant(s): reads (% of aligned) (position or count):	7 (28%) (chromosome_A + 100-?)

<IGNORE> the 99-100-101 group should be merged (distance 1, ratio 5) (this constitutes two pairs)
chromosome_A	+	100	100-?	gene_unknown	?	?	7	5	1
<IGNORE> the 200-202 group should NOT be merged (distance 2, ratio 3)
chromosome_A	+	200	200-?	gene_unknown	?	?	3	3	1
chromosome_A	+	202	202-?	gene_unknown	?	?	1	1	1
<IGNORE> the 201-301 group should be merged (distance 1, ratio 1) - into the lower position by default

<IGNORE> the 500 group should be merged as a tandem
chromosome_A	both	500	500-501	gene_unknown	?	?	2	2	1
<IGNORE> the remaining groups are adjacent on opposite strands (distance 0, 1, 2) and should never be merged.
