### SUMMARY:
## Total reads processed: 25+unknown
#  Reads discarded in preprocessing (% of total): unknown (unknown)
#  Unaligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing): 0 (0%, 0%)
#  Aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing): 25 (100%, 100%)
#  Perfectly aligned reads, no mismatches (% of aligned): 25 (100%)
#  Reads with cassette direction matching chromosome + strand (% of aligned): 22 (88%)
#  Reads with cassette direction matching chromosome - strand (% of aligned): 3 (12%)
## Distinct mutants (read groups) by cassette insertion position: 13
#  (read is at 5prime end of cassette, in forward direction to cassette)
#  (average and median reads per mutant: 2, 1)
#  merged 2 pairs of adjacent mutants (max distance 1, min count ratio 3) 
#    (kept 1 pairs on same strand and 1 on opposite strands)
#    (there were also 1 pairs in exact same position on different strands non-cassette (and 0 cassette))
#  Most common mutant: position [chromosome_A + 100-?], 7 reads (28% of aligned)
