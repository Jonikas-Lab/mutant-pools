### SUMMARY:
#  Reads discarded in preprocessing: unknown
## Total reads processed: 25
#  Unaligned reads: 0
#  Aligned reads (non-discarded): 25
#  Perfectly aligned reads (no mismatches): 25
#  Reads with insertion direction matching chromosome + strand: 22
#  Reads with insertion direction matching chromosome - strand: 3
## Distinct mutants (read groups) by cassette insertion position: 13
#  (read is at 5prime end of cassette, in forward direction to cassette)
#  merged 2 pairs of adjacent mutants (max distance 1, min count ratio 3) 
#    (kept 1 pairs on same strand and 1 on opposite strands)
#  Most common mutant: position [chromosome_A + 100-?], 7 reads (28% of aligned)

<IGNORE> the 99-100-101 group should be merged (distance 1, ratio 5) (this constitutes two pairs)

<IGNORE> the 200-202 group should NOT be merged (distance 2, ratio 3)
chromosome_A	+	200	200-?	gene_unknown	?	?	3	3	1
