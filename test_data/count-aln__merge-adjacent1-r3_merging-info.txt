# Merging adjacent mutants: max distance 1, min count ratio 3
 (The merged mutant will have the position of whichever original mutant had more reads)
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
 MERGING same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 99-? and chromosome_A + 100-?, 1 and 5 reads.
 MERGING same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 100-? and chromosome_A + 101-?, 6 and 1 reads.
# Finished merging adjacent mutants: 2 pairs merged
# Merging opposite-strand same-position mutants (presumably tail-to-tail tandems)
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
 MERGING opposite-strand same-position tandem mutants: chromosome_A + 500-? and chromosome_A - ?-501.
# Finished merging opposite-strand same-position mutants: 1 pairs merged
# Counting adjacent mutants: max distance 1
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (including non-nuclear chromosomes)
  same-strand adjacent mutants: chromosome_A + 300-? and chromosome_A + 301-?, 1 and 1 reads.
  adjacent opposite-strand "away-facing" mutants: chromosome_A + 600-? and chromosome_A - ?-602.
# Finished counting adjacent mutants (max distance 1): 1 adjacent same-strand pairs, 0 same-position opposite-strand pairs, 1 adjacent opposite-strand "away-facing" pairs (may be tandems with a deletion), 0 adjacent opposite-strand "toward-facing" pairs (definitely two separate mutants).
