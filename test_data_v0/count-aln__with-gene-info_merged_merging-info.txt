# Counting adjacent mutants: actually counting mutants up to distance 10000, but only printing info for up to distance 1 - you can get the full data from the pickle file
 (not including cassette chromosomes) (not including non-nuclear chromosomes)
  opposite-strand same-position tandem mutants: chromosome_A + 210-? and chromosome_A - ?-211, 1 and 1 reads.
  opposite-strand same-position tandem mutants: chromosome_A + 1210-? and chromosome_A - ?-1211, 1 and 1 reads.
# Finished counting (actually counted mutants up to distance 10000, but only printing info for up to distance 1 - you can get the full data from the pickle file). Adjacent mutant counts (max distance 1): 0 adjacent same-strand pairs, 2 same-position opposite-strand pairs, 0 adjacent opposite-strand away-facing pairs (may be tandems with a deletion), 0 adjacent opposite-strand toward-facing pairs (definitely two separate mutants).
