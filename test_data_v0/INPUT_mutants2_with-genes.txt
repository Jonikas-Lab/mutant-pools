### SUMMARY:
#  Reads discarded in preprocessing:	unknown
## Total reads processed:	14
#  Unaligned reads:	0
#  Aligned reads (non-discarded):	14
#  Perfectly aligned reads (no mismatches):	11
#  Reads with insertion direction matching chromosome + strand:	11
#  Reads with insertion direction matching chromosome - strand:	3
## Distinct mutants (read groups) by cassette insertion position:	3
#  (read is at 5prime end of cassette, in forward direction to cassette)
#  Most common mutant:	position [chromosome_A + 100-?], 9 reads (64% of aligned)
