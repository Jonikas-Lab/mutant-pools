### SUMMARY:
## Total reads in sample:	45
## Reads discarded in preprocessing (% of total):	5 (11%)
#  discarded due to wrong start (% of total):	1 (2.2%)
#  discarded due to no cassette (% of total):	4 (8.9%)
## Reads without a unique alignment (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	10 (22%, 25%)
#  unaligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	6 (13%, 15%)
#  multiply aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	4 (8.9%, 10%)
## Uniquely aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	30 (67%, 75%)
#  Removed reads aligned to NON-CASSETTE (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	29 (64%, 72%)
## Remaining aligned reads (% of total, % of post-preprocessing):	1 (2.2%, 2.5%)
#  Perfectly aligned reads, no mismatches (% of aligned):	1 (100%)
#  Reads with cassette direction matching chromosome + strand (% of aligned):	1 (100%)
#  Reads with cassette direction matching chromosome - strand (% of aligned):	0 (0%)
## Mutant merging/counts (deciding when different-position reads should be one mutant)	
#   (adjacent-merging/counting max distance):	(1)
#   (if we're including mutants in cassette and in non-nuclear chromosomes):	(True, False)
#  merged same-strand adjacent mutant pairs and opposite-strand tandem pairs:	0, 0
#  remaining same-position opposite-strand pairs (if not merged as tandems):	0
#  remaining adjacent opposite-strand "toward-facing" pairs (those are definitely real):	0
#  remaining adjacent opposite-strand "away-facing" pairs (% of toward-facing):	0 (N/A)
#  remaining adjacent same-strand unmerged pairs (% of 2*toward-facing):	0 (N/A)
## Distinct mutants (read groups) by cassette insertion position:	1
#  (mutants with 2+, 10+, 100+, 1000+ reads):	(0, 0, 0, 0)
#  (read location with respect to cassette: which end, which direction):	(5prime, forward)
#  (average and median reads per mutant):	(1, 1)
#  Most common mutant(s): reads (% of aligned) (position or count):	1 (100%) (insertion_cassette_X + 104-?)
